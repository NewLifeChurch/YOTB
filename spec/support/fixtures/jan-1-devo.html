<p>The opening chapters of the Old and New Testaments bring to the forefront two couples: Adam and Eve in the Old Testament and Mary and Joseph in the New. Their stories emphasize the concepts of family and community. Adam and Eve were created to enjoy each other as husband and wife. Their family was in community with God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Sin had not yet broken this beautiful fellowship between man and wife and God and humanity.</p><p>Soon, however, sin did enter the world, but Mary and Joseph’s family began the restoration of the human race back to God. In their community, God placed His Son Jesus to restore God’s fellowship to humanity (community) and humanity’s fellowship with one another (family). Nothing was wrong with God’s original plan—it was “excellent in every way” (Genesis 1:31).</p><p>Let us start this year by asking the Lord to restore to us our fellowship with Him in any area that has been broken by sin. Then let us ask Him to restore family in relationships with others whom we have offended. Jesus came to bring us back to God’s original plan!</p>
